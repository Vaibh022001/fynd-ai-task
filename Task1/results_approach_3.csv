1,1,1,"The review expresses strong negativity regarding the service and the quality of the sushi, especially considering the high prices.

7,1,2,"The review is largely negative. While acknowledging Forever 21 wasn't directly responsible for the theft, the reviewer criticizes the staff's indifference and the store's disorganization. The store was a mess, understaffed, and employees were socializing instead of helping customers. The theft incident compounded the negative experience.",True,1.6388704776763916
8,1,2,"The review is primarily negative. While the reviewer didn't get sick at the deli and liked the fries, they found the sandwich overpriced, not huge as advertised, flavorless, and disliked the coleslaw.

The positives are not enough to outweigh the negatives.",True,8.62587857246399
17,2,3,"The review expresses both positive and negative sentiments about the food. While some items (chips, red salsa, chicken, service) are praised, others (green sauce, beans, rice) are criticized.

Seafood freshness was a positive. The 'probably give another try' suggests neutrality.",True,3.1201376914978027
21,3,3,"The review starts with a desire to give 4 stars, but the inconsistent stale bread issue prevents it. While the reviewer praises the overall store and selection, the bread issue is a significant negative affecting the deli experience. Therefore, a neutral 3-star rating seems appropriate.",True,3.107123613357544

27,3,3,"The review is initially very positive, awarding 5 stars to uniqueness of food, staff, and location.

This mixed experience points towards a neutral rating.",True,2.7587625980377197

The tone suggests a significant decline in the quality of the establishment.",True,2.363619804382324

The service is described as 'marginal at best' but the reviewer states it 'didn't annoy me' indicating the negative aspect is not significant enough to lower the rating significantly.
